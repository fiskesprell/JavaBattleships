---- Todos ------
[ ] Prevent a guess that is out of bounds ( guess > 100 or guess < 0 )
[ ] Fix bot behaviour where it goes back to random guessing without exploring all possibilities
[ ] change bot/guessesCanContinueDirection from going off RootHit to going off lastHit

---- Last Playtest Output -----

The placement of the player ships was as follows:
A1(1), B1(11), C1(21), D1(31)
A7(7), B7(17), C7(27), D7(37)
A10(10), B10(20), C10(30), D10(40)
E3, E4, E5, E6, E7
F5, F6, F7
H2, I2, J2


The bot guessed as follows:
67 - miss
22 - miss
95 - miss
79 - miss
20 - hit (B10)
30 - hit (correct logic, could not go right so went down next.)
40 - hit (correct logic, continues the direction of the second hit)
50 - miss (correct logic, same logic as previous)
10 - hit (correct logic, goes from root in opposite direction. this time up.)
0 - out of bounds (should not be possible, though I do not have logic for this and it likely counts as a miss so there isnt a problem for me if this is counted as a miss)
35 - miss (goes back to random. correct logic so far)
8 - hit (random guess. correct logic so far).
9 - miss (guessed right first, correct logic so far)
98 - miss - seems random. (expected it to try go down after going right once, which it already did. Expected it to try 18).
84 - miss - (seems to have gone back to random guessing, breaking out of the exploringStage loop.
